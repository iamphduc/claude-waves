# Engineer protocol

Execute a scoped task on a dedicated branch in an isolated worktree. Report only via the final structured summary.

## Required dispatch context

- **sprint slug**, **slice code**, **branch name**
- **scope**, **files owned**, **success criteria**
- **merge-target branch** — the branch you base your worktree on and the orchestrator integrates into: `<plan-slug>` under the wave loop; standalone callers derive it per **Standalone invocation**.
- **parent-repo path** — absolute path of the main repo
- **worktree path** — absolute path of your working dir
- **dev ports** *(optional, default `web 3900` / `api 3901`)* — use exactly these; never pick your own, never retry on a neighbouring port. Already serving this worktree → reuse it; occupied by anything else → `BLOCKED`.
- **teardown** *(optional, default `immediate`)* — `defer` (leave the worktree after pushing; the orchestrator removes it post-merge) or `immediate` (remove it yourself once pushed).

Any required field missing → minimal summary with a `BLOCKED` concern naming the gaps, skip all work, end. Never `BLOCKED` on `teardown` or `dev ports`, and never when dispatched standalone — derive those per the next section.

## Standalone invocation

Only `/fix` dispatches you with just a task description. Derive the rest, don't block:

- **parent-repo:** `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`, trailing `/.git` stripped. Never cwd.
- **merge-target:** the `--merge-target=<branch>` you were passed, else origin's default branch (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`), else `main`. A fix cuts off trunk, never off a plan branch.
- **naming:** slug is short kebab-case from the task — `sprint slug` = `fix`, `slice code` = `<slug>`, `branch` = `fix-<slug>`, worktree `<parent-repo>/.claude/worktrees/fix-<slug>/`.
- **scope, files owned, success criteria:** infer from the task, capping files owned to what it plausibly touches.
- **teardown:** `defer` — the `/fix` loop removes the worktree once the PR merges.
- **worktree:** a follow-up fix names an existing worktree path — `cd` in and reuse it; otherwise create it per **Your worktree**.

## Your worktree

The orchestrator normally pre-creates your worktree and passes its path; `cd` into it. If it doesn't exist (standalone `/fix`, or a pasted prompt), create it first:

`git fetch origin && git worktree add <worktree-path> -b <branch-name> origin/<merge-target>`

## Path discipline

Never write into the parent repo. **Every `Edit`/`Write` path must be absolute and under `<worktree-path>` — never relative, never outside it. Verify before writing; if not, stop.** (`Read` outside is fine.)

`cd "<worktree-path>"` once at turn start so Bash runs there.

## Surfacing concerns

Never silently fill ambiguity — flag it. In your summary, list each as `[TYPE] one-line body`:

- `BLOCKED` — you cannot proceed, or verification failed.
- `PENDING` — defensible default taken, knowingly-incomplete spot, or scope-creep opportunity.
- `SOLVED` — only alongside a `BLOCKED` or `PENDING`: marks a related thing resolved inline.

Any `BLOCKED` → stop immediately: no push, no PR, no cleanup. Leave the worktree intact for inspection.

## Shipping the work (only when no BLOCKED)

1. **Static checks.** Tests / typecheck / lint / build. Any failure → `BLOCKED`, including ones you didn't cause. No harness → say so in the summary, cap Confidence at `medium`.
2. **Runtime verification.** Bring the app up per the `## Smoke recipe` in `docs/codebase-structure.md` on your **dev ports**, then drive every affected route with the `chrome-devtools` tools — DOM snapshot, console, and network, not just that the page loaded. Failing behavior → fix and re-verify (re-run step 1 if you changed code), or `BLOCKED` if it needs judgment. Stop every server you started; record what you drove. Nothing to drive, or no smoke recipe → say so, cap Confidence at `medium`.
3. **Commit and push** (message prefixed with the slice code). Wave-loop slice → **no PR**, report the branch. `/fix` and the reviewer → open a PR against merge-target, report the URL.
4. **Clean up** when `teardown` is `immediate`: `cd "<parent-repo-path>"` → `git worktree remove <worktree-path>` → `git branch -d <branch-name>`. Never `git checkout` in the parent repo. Failure → `PENDING`, Cleanup `partial`. When `defer`, leave both intact, Cleanup `deferred — worktree <worktree-path> retained`.

Never use `--force` or `-D` — if something blocks, let a human investigate.

## Final output

End your turn with the structured summary at `docs/templates/engineer-summary.md`, inline (not written to a file); read it at turn start.
