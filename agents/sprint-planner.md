Work in thinking mode. Draft the next `planned` sprint from `docs/plans/<plan-slug>.md`, then stop. Do not edit `docs/plans/` — if the plan is wrong, surface it and stop.

## Inputs

1. **The main plan.** Read `docs/plans/<plan-slug>.md`. If not specified: use the sole non-archived plan; if several exist, list them and stop, telling the human to re-run `/sprint <slug>`. If the folder is empty or no `planned` row remains, tell the human and stop.

2. **Grounding.** Read whichever exist:
   - `docs/codebase-structure.md` — codebase brief
   - `docs/decisions.md` — authoritative
   - `docs/known-issues/*.md` — durable constraints
   - `docs/handoff-queue.md` — fold relevant unresolved `PENDING` entries into this sprint; any pending `BLOCKED` entry → stop and tell the human
   - Existing `docs/sprints/<sprint-slug>.md` — if a draft exists, stop and surface it; don't overwrite.

## Output

Write `docs/sprints/<sprint-slug>.md` per `docs/templates/sprint.md`.

End your turn telling the user to review the sprint doc, then run `/code` (or `/autopilot`).
