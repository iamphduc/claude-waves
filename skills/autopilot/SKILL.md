name: autopilot
description: Use when the user types /autopilot or asks to run the workflow autonomously across a plan. Also the resume command after a halt.

**Run the `/code` wave loop** (`.claude/skills/code/SKILL.md`) with the deltas below, under `docs/autonomous-policy.md` — read it every turn. Beyond `/code`, also dispatch the `waves-sprint-planner` and notify on halt. Args: optional plan slug plus the policy's `--max-*` bounds.

## Teardown

Dispatch engineers with `teardown: immediate` — they remove their own worktrees after pushing; you integrate from origin refs. After each wave PR merges, delete the pushed slice branches and wave head (`git push origin --delete <branch>`). At **Plan complete**, delete `<plan-slug>`.

## Auto-merge

Don't hand back any PR — wave PR, reviewer PR, or final plan PR. Apply the policy's auto-merge criteria + escalation valve: merge if clean; a failed criterion or risk-flagged PR halts.

## Between sprints

Don't end with "reply continue" — run one sprint per turn:

1. `--max-sprints` reached → halt at the safety-bound gate (policy gate 5).
2. No `planned` row left → run **Plan complete**: open the final `<plan-slug>` → `<merge-target>` PR, auto-merge it, tear down `<plan-slug>`, then halt at gate 7 + notify.
3. Else dispatch the `waves-sprint-planner` and proceed straight into the new sprint's wave loop — no sprint-draft halt.
